# Kota Kinabalu Bus Route Chart
Currently there are no known public bus transit route created or made to public.

## Current problem
There are no known routes where the bus driver will take except by asking them directly or others who often commute by them. Even with that, the information are still quite vague. As of now, Google Maps doesn't support "transit" feature in this city, hence leaving the current public transit in the shadows.

## Aim
To create public bus transit map chart to assist anyone who are planning to commute via these bus transits. By just using google map links.

## Aren't they supposed to be centralised?
No, The public bus transit in Kota Kinabalu (KK) are clustered, meaning that almost each one of the bus drivers are independent to one another. The chart of their routes are not maintained even by the city hall I don't think.

## Fares
They're generally a minimum of MYR2.00 upon boarding and it will increase on farther destination. Just ask the driver how much the fares by stating where you boarded the bus. Don't worry, they won't scam you.

## Schedule
Generally they don't have any departure schedule, some of the busses may take longer while some take shorter time to depart. It will be stated on each destination's note/condition.

## Contributing
You're free to contribute to this project by sending a pull request. As of now there are no good formating to use for each of the regions yet.
